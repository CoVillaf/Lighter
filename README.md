# Lighter

This is a workspace for building `Lighter`, a stand-alone program which runs an
HTTP server allowing clients to control an LED strip.

## Building

This is a stand-alone workspace which uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to
generate the build system and provide the application with its dependencies.

There are two distinct steps in the build process:

1. Generation of the build system, using CMake
2. Compiling, linking, etc., using CMake-compatible toolchain

### Prerequisites

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.8 or newer
* C++11 toolchain compatible with CMake for your development platform (e.g.
  [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) on Windows)

### Build system generation

Generate the build system using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) from the solution root.  For example:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A "x64" ..
```

### Compiling, linking, et cetera

Either use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) or your toolchain's IDE to build.
For [CMake](https://cmake.org/):

```bash
cd build
cmake --build . --config Release
```
